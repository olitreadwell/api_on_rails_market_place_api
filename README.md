Notes on my work with API on Rails

- using Pow, by basecamp. zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X
- versioning api as a way to make it future proof
- setting the api to be part of the subdomain
  other methods mentioned are `domain.com/api/` and `domain.com/api/v1/`
- using Rspec and TDD
- we will be using Devise for authentication
